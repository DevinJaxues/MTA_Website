            <p class="bio-summary">Brady is a founding partner of Martin Tax & Advisory and is committed to being a trusted advisor for his clients in every stage of life and business. He believes the real value of an advisor comes from long-term relationships built on trust — the kind where clients know they can call him not only for tax planning and business strategy, but also when the unexpected happens.</p>
            <div class="bio-full"> 
              <p>Brady takes the time to understand each client’s unique situation, goals, and family dynamics so he can provide advice that truly fits their needs.

His goal is to build relationships that span years and generations, built on trust, consistency, and genuine care.

With a strong understanding of the tax code and broad knowledge across most industries, Brady and his team are equipped to serve clients in nearly any field. He loves the challenge of complexity and enjoys continually learning — whether it’s mastering new tax strategies or understanding the evolving industries his clients operate in. Brady is passionate about helping clients build and preserve their wealth while saving on taxes, providing strategies that not only solve today’s problems but also create long-term financial advantages. Brady earned both his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in accounting from Utah State University, where he competed on the track and field team in the 400 meters, earned NCAA All-American honors and won multiple Mountain West Conference Championship event titles. Outside of the office, Brady enjoys time with his wife, Breann, and their son. He loves golf, riding his dirt bike, and the gym. Most weekends you’ll find him with family or friends — whether it’s on the golf course, riding in the mountains, or chasing his son around the yard.</p>
