                <p>Troy Martin doesn’t just interpret the tax code—he leverages it as a strategic tool for wealth creation and business growth. With over 35 years of experience advising business owners, executives, and affluent families, Troy has built a reputation as a trusted partner who delivers clarity, confidence, and measurable results in an increasingly complex financial world.</p>
                <p>High-performing individuals and business leaders seek Troy’s expertise not only to minimize tax exposure but also to unlock opportunities that others overlook. His proactive approach focuses on advanced income tax and estate tax planning, succession strategies, mergers and acquisitions, and value maximization for closely held businesses. Troy’s ability to integrate tax, business, and personal wealth strategies sets him apart as a guide for clients who want more than compliance—they want vision.</p>
                <p>Troy is deeply engaged in learning the intricacies of each client’s goals and enterprises.

                <p>When he’s not advising clients, Troy embraces a life of adventure—whether it’s on a Harley Davidson, a dirt bike, or exploring the outdoors through fly fishing, diving, playing golf with family and friends, and traveling. His drive for new experiences mirrors his professional philosophy: growth comes from embracing challenges and pursuing opportunities with purpose.</p>
