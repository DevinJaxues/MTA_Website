      </div>

      <div class="faq-list">
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Do you prepare both business and personal tax returns?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes — we specialize in both business and individual tax preparation. Whether you're a sole proprietor, S-Corporation, partnership, or multi-entity business owner, we handle federal and multi-state tax returns across all 50 states. We also align your personal tax return with your company’s strategy to ensure efficiency and accuracy.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What size businesses do you typically work with?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>We work with a wide range of businesses, from solo entrepreneurs and startups to multi-entity companies with employees and contractors. Our services scale based on your needs—whether you need monthly bookkeeping, strategic advisory, or both.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Can you help me catch up on overdue bookkeeping or taxes?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Absolutely. We regularly help clients catch up on several years of backlogged bookkeeping, unfiled tax returns, and unresolved IRS notices. We’ll clean up your records, resolve urgent issues, and help you stay on track going forward with organized, audit-ready financials.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What accounting method should my business use — cash or accrual?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Choosing between cash and accrual accounting depends on your business size, complexity, and industry. Cash basis is simpler and tracks income when received and expenses when paid. Accrual basis recognizes revenue and expenses when they’re earned or incurred, offering a more accurate long-term financial picture. Accrual is required for businesses that carry inventory or make over $25M in annual revenue. A tax advisor can help you determine the right method and how to make a change if needed.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How should I pay myself as a business owner?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>How you pay yourself depends on your entity type. Sole proprietors and single-member LLCs typically take “owner draws.” S-Corp owners must pay themselves a “reasonable salary” through payroll. C-Corp owners are employees and should receive W-2 wages. Getting this wrong can result in IRS scrutiny, so it’s important to structure your compensation correctly for both tax savings and compliance.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Can you run payroll for my business?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes — we offer full-service payroll for S-Corps, LLCs, and small teams, including W-2s, 1099s, direct deposit, quarterly filings, and state compliance. We also advise on reasonable compensation for S-Corp owners to stay IRS-compliant.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Do you help new businesses with setup and strategy?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Definitely. We guide you through entity selection (LLC vs S-Corp), IRS and state registrations, accounting systems setup, and first-year tax planning. Starting smart saves thousands in the long run—and we’ll help you build a solid financial foundation.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Can you help me respond to an IRS notice or audit?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes — we represent clients before the IRS and state tax agencies. Whether it’s a letter, penalty notice, CP2000, or full audit, we’ll help you understand what’s needed, communicate on your behalf, and resolve the issue as efficiently as possible.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Do I need to make estimated tax payments as a business owner?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>If you’re self-employed, an S-Corp owner, or earn income outside of a W-2, you likely need to make quarterly estimated payments. We’ll calculate and track your estimates, help you avoid penalties, and adjust throughout the year as your income changes.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Can you review my previous tax returns to look for errors or savings?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes — we offer tax return reviews to identify missed deductions, improper classifications, or overlooked opportunities. If we find savings or corrections, we can file amended returns to recover overpaid taxes. Many clients recover thousands this way.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Do you work with clients outside of Utah?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Absolutely. We serve businesses and individuals in all 50 states. Our systems are remote-friendly and secure, making it easy to collaborate via client portal, Zoom, and cloud-based tools. We also handle multi-state tax issues and registrations.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What's the difference between a CPA, bookkeeper, and CFO?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>A bookkeeper handles day-to-day transaction tracking and reconciliations. A CPA focuses on tax compliance and filings. A CFO provides strategic advice and financial direction. At Martin Tax & Advisory, we combine all three—so your entire financial picture works together.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What records do I need to keep for taxes?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>You should keep receipts, invoices, bank and credit card statements, payroll reports, mileage logs, and tax filings for at least 3 to 7 years. The IRS requires documentation to support income, deductions, and credits. Digital copies are acceptable if they are accurate and accessible. Well-organized records make tax prep easier and reduce audit risk.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Do you offer year-round tax planning or just filing?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>We provide proactive, year-round tax planning—not just last-minute filings. Our goal is to minimize your tax burden through strategic decisions made throughout the year. Tax efficiency is built into everything we do.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">When are estimated taxes due and how do I calculate them?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Estimated tax payments are generally due quarterly in April, June, September, and January. If you expect to owe at least $1,000 in taxes and don’t have taxes withheld from wages, you’re required to make them. Calculating them involves projecting your annual income and applying your effective tax rate. Penalties apply if you underpay, so planning ahead is key.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What’s considered a deductible business expense?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Deductible business expenses must be both ordinary and necessary for your trade or profession. Common deductions include advertising, software, office supplies, business meals, travel, phone and internet, professional services, and vehicle use. Keeping detailed records and separating personal and business expenses is critical for compliance and maximizing deductions.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How do I handle payroll taxes for employees?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Employers must withhold income, Social Security, and Medicare taxes from employee wages, and pay employer-side taxes as well. Payroll filings (like Form 941 and state reports) are due quarterly, and W-2s must be issued annually. Many businesses use payroll software or outsource to ensure accuracy and avoid penalties for late or incorrect filings.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What’s the difference between a contractor and an employee?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Contractors (1099) control how and when they work, provide their own tools, and invoice you for services. Employees (W-2) are subject to your control and direction. Misclassifying workers can result in fines, back taxes, and liability. The IRS uses a 20-point test to determine proper classification, so it’s important to assess carefully.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Should I form an LLC or an S-Corp for my business?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>An LLC is a flexible legal structure with pass-through taxation. An S-Corp is a tax election that can be applied to an LLC or corporation. S-Corp status can save on self-employment taxes if you’re profitable enough to justify running payroll. However, it adds administrative overhead. Your decision should be based on income, goals, and compliance readiness.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What financial reports should I be reviewing monthly?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Business owners should review their Profit & Loss (P&L), Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement every month. These reports show your income, expenses, assets, liabilities, and cash position. They help you make informed decisions, catch issues early, and prepare for tax time. Clean books are also crucial if you apply for loans or investors.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Can I deduct my home office?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes — if you regularly and exclusively use a space in your home for business, you may qualify for the home office deduction. You can calculate it using one of two methods. The rules are strict, so documentation and exclusivity are key.</p></div>
