        <h2>Tax Compliance</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Tax compliance isn’t just about filing on time — it’s about reducing risk. Inaccurate or late filings can lead to IRS scrutiny, penalties, and audits that disrupt your business or personal finances. A professional tax compliance partner ensures your obligations are met accurately, on time, and with confidence.</p>
        <p><strong>What We Do:</strong> We manage the full tax filing lifecycle, including preparation of federal, state, and local returns for individuals, businesses, estates, and trusts. Our team tracks changing tax laws to ensure every deduction and credit is properly applied. We also offer year-end reporting, estimated payments, and representation for audits, all while maintaining clean records and documentation.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Peace of mind, reduced audit risk, and confidence that your returns are fully compliant with current tax law.</p>

        <h2>Tax Planning</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Without strategic tax planning, you could be leaving thousands of dollars on the table. The tax code is designed with incentives — but only if you plan ahead. Proactive planning reduces your liability, eliminates surprises at tax time, and aligns your strategy with both short and long-term financial goals.</p>
        <p><strong>What We Do:</strong> We build personalized tax strategies for both individuals and businesses. This includes quarterly check-ins, income timing, deductions optimization, retirement contribution planning, entity structure evaluation, and tax-loss harvesting.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Reduced tax liability, optimized cash flow, and a proactive approach that prevents end-of-year stress.</p>

        <h2>Business Structure & Setup</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Your business entity affects everything — your tax rate, liability, how you get paid, and future expansion. Choosing incorrectly at the start can limit growth or create unnecessary risk.</p>
        <p><strong>What We Do:</strong> We guide you through choosing between LLCs, S-Corps, C-Corps, partnerships, and sole proprietorships. We handle state registration, EIN acquisition, tax elections, and help with payroll and accounting setup.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Reduced liability, maximized tax efficiency, and a streamlined launch.</p>

        <h2>Business Succession Planning</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Without a succession plan, even a thriving business can collapse. Whether transitioning to family, partners, or a buyer, clear planning preserves value and ensures operations continue smoothly.</p>
        <p><strong>What We Do:</strong> We assist with valuations, ownership transfer, buy-sell agreements, estate planning, and tax planning to help transition business leadership securely.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Minimized tax liability, preserved legacy, and smoother transitions.</p>

        <h2>CFO/CEO Consulting</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Financial decisions drive growth, but many companies can’t justify a full-time CFO. With fractional consulting, you gain strategic insight at a fraction of the cost.</p>
        <p><strong>What We Do:</strong> Forecasting, budgeting, profitability analysis, cash flow planning, and executive-level strategy — without hiring in-house.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Data-driven growth, better pricing models, and improved decision-making.</p>

        <h2>QuickBooks Setup & Consulting</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Poor bookkeeping setup leads to constant errors. QuickBooks done right saves hours and headaches later.</p>
        <p><strong>What We Do:</strong> Initial setup, chart of accounts, integrations, data migration, cleanup, and ongoing support.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Accurate financials, faster closings, and clean records year-round.</p>
