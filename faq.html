      </div>

      <div class="faq-list">
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Do you prepare both business and personal tax returns?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes — we specialize in both business and individual tax preparation. Whether you're a sole proprietor, S-Corporation, partnership, or multi-entity business owner, we handle federal and multi-state tax returns across all 50 states. We also align your personal tax return with your company’s strategy to ensure efficiency and accuracy.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">What size businesses do you typically work with?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer"><p>We work with a wide range of businesses, from solo entrepreneurs and startups to multi-entity companies with employees and contractors. Our services scale based on your needs—whether you need monthly bookkeeping, strategic advisory, or both.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Can you help me catch up on overdue bookkeeping or taxes?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer"><p>Absolutely. We regularly help clients catch up on several years of backlogged bookkeeping, unfiled tax returns, and unresolved IRS notices. We’ll clean up your records, resolve urgent issues, and help you stay on track going forward with organized, audit-ready financials.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">How do you price your bookkeeping and accounting services?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer"><p>We offer flat-rate monthly packages tailored to your business size, complexity, and service needs. No hourly billing. No hidden fees. You’ll receive transparent pricing that reflects the scope of services—from basic reconciliations to full advisory support.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">What’s included in your fractional CFO service?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer"><p>Our fractional CFO service gives you strategic financial leadership without hiring in-house. We help with forecasting, cash flow management, tax strategy, budgeting, growth planning, and financial oversight. Ideal for businesses scaling from six to eight figures.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Can you run payroll for my business?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes — we offer full-service payroll for S-Corps, LLCs, and small teams, including W-2s, 1099s, direct deposit, quarterly filings, and state compliance. We also advise on reasonable compensation for S-Corp owners to stay IRS-compliant.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Do you help new businesses with setup and strategy?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer"><p>Definitely. We guide you through entity selection (LLC vs S-Corp), IRS and state registrations, accounting systems setup, and first-year tax planning. Starting smart saves thousands in the long run—and we’ll help you build a solid financial foundation.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Can you help me respond to an IRS notice or audit?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes — we represent clients before the IRS and state tax agencies. Whether it’s a letter, penalty notice, CP2000, or full audit, we’ll help you understand what’s needed, communicate on your behalf, and resolve the issue as efficiently as possible.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Do I need to make estimated tax payments as a business owner?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer"><p>If you’re self-employed, an S-Corp owner, or earn income outside of a W-2, you likely need to make quarterly estimated payments. We’ll calculate and track your estimates, help you avoid penalties, and adjust throughout the year as your income changes.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Can you review my previous tax returns to look for errors or savings?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes — we offer tax return reviews to identify missed deductions, improper classifications, or overlooked opportunities. If we find savings or corrections, we can file amended returns to recover overpaid taxes. Many clients recover thousands this way.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Do you work with clients outside of Utah?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer"><p>Absolutely. We serve businesses and individuals in all 50 states. Our systems are remote-friendly and secure, making it easy to collaborate via client portal, Zoom, and cloud-based tools. We also handle multi-state tax issues and registrations.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">What's the difference between a CPA, bookkeeper, and CFO?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer"><p>A bookkeeper handles day-to-day transaction tracking and reconciliations. A CPA focuses on tax compliance and filings. A CFO provides strategic advice and financial direction. At Martin Tax & Advisory, we combine all three—so your entire financial picture works together.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Do you require a long-term contract?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer"><p>No long-term contracts required. Most services are month-to-month. We believe in earning your trust through results, not locking you in. Cancel anytime with notice, or scale up/down based on your needs.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Do you offer year-round tax planning or just filing?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer"><p>We provide proactive, year-round tax planning—not just last-minute filings. Our goal is to minimize your tax burden through strategic decisions made throughout the year. Tax efficiency is built into everything we do.</p></div>
